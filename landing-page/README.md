# Landing Page Project

I have added the sections via JavaScript.

I created a function to create a link for each section.

Modified the active class properties for both section and link.

I made the icon appear after scaling to some pixels.

All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.

When clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section.
